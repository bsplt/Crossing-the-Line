# Crossing-the-Line
### Objecting the Digital Artifactual Objection Course

**Crossing the Line** is the result of a short term assignment in the Digital Media program at HfK Bremen for the Digital Artifactual Objection course.
It's a simple Chrome Extension that sktrikes through the ~~teacher~~'s messages in the Slack team.
What lead me here is stubbornness but I guess it's okay.

To install it, download the files, open the extensions settings in your Chrome browser, check the developer mode box and load the folder.
